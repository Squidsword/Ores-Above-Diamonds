This is the open source code of the Minecraft mod Ores Above Diamonds. Feel free to use it, contribute to it, or do anything else you want with it.
1.16.2 has errors and hasn't been finished yet. There has been changes to world generation, I think it uses .json files now or something. I'm still new to git so I'm still trying to get the hang of things.
